Chapter 7

2007年我失业在家无所事事，先做了几天DIY，然后开始思考未来。眼见着银行账号的余额越来越少，我却束手无策。我提不起劲，经营公司、画大饼、上当受骗让我付出了代价。虽然我还没有做好迎接新角色的准备，但也不能坐以待毙。于是我进行了一些有偿演讲，做了一些咨询工作，写了几篇文章，又代写了几篇，还进行了一些研究。这些动作至少帮我解决了燃眉之急。

我确信地图这个概念有些优势，但我还有两个主要问题需要解决。第一，我没能用地图创造出光明的未来。第二，我没有真正的证据支持。我收集的数据变现出了组件变化的迹象，但演变坐标轴只不过我发现并在2004年Euro Foo上讲过的一种模式。地图这个概念也许完全错了？也许这就是我失败的原因？也许这也是没什么人会谈到这个概念的原因？我觉得家里书架上的书还是太少了，回答不了这些问题，于是我扎进了大英图书馆。为了寻找答案，我收集、整理和搜索了大量文献。至少，我让自己一直有事做，正好利用这段时间让自己平复下来。

As I read more into the subject of strategy then I noticed that disquiet over the field was palpable. Phil Rosenzweig, in the Halo Effect (2007) pointed to the cause being a marriage of convenience: “Managers are busy people, under enormous pressure to deliver higher revenues, greater profits and ever larger returns for shareholders. They naturally search for ready-made answers, for tidy plug-and-play solutions that might give them a leg up on their rivals. And the people who write business books — consultants and business school professors and strategy gurus — are happy to oblige.”
战略主题的文献读得越多，我就越焦虑。罗森维（Phil Rosenzweig）在《光环效应》 (2007) 中指出了这场各取所需的联姻背后的原因：“管理者是忙碌的人，承受着为股东带来更高收入、更高利润和更大回报的巨大压力。他们自然而然地寻找现成的答案，寻找整洁的即插即用解决方案，这些解决方案可能会让他们在竞争对手中脱颖而出。写商业书籍的人——顾问、商学院教授和战略大师——很乐意帮忙。”

我不想这样，我想把秘籍公开，为所有人提供自我提升的工具。我想摆脱这种虚假的联姻。2007年时，我仍然相信秘籍是存在的，有可能被商学院保护得严严实实。我想是不是要去读MBA，但高昂的学费让我知难而退，于是我从读过MBA的朋友那里借来了笔记和书籍。然而，我大失所望。除了财务、营销和运营“战略”的基本概念之外，找不到任何环境或背景的讨论。难道秘籍是在战略咨询公司那里？

I applied for a job with one of the more prestigious consultancy firms and I was invited to a competitive interview process with dozens of other candidates. We would be put through our paces in a number of rounds in a Darwinian battle, a survival of the fittest. In my first round I was asked a question — “A news media company is looking at divesting itself of its print and distribution business. What things should it consider?”
我向一家更有声望的咨询公司申请了一份工作，并被邀请与其他数十名候选人一起参加竞争激烈的面试过程。在一场适者生存的达尔文式战斗中，我们将经历多轮考验。在我的第一轮面试中，我被问到一个问题——“一家新闻媒体公司正在考虑剥离其印刷和发行业务。它应该考虑哪些事情？”

I immediately starting mapping out the landscape, pointing to opportunities and impacts from loss of control through disposal of such physical capital to provision of distribution as a public utility to redirecting print capabilities into printed electronics — “those large scale printers have the potential to be tomorrow’s Intel I declared!” There was a wealth of opportunity but before making a choice then we needed to understand the landscape more. I started to dig, asking questions about the user, their needs and what did we understand about the landscape. I met a wall of silence followed by the line that “it’s not relevant”. The company had already decided to take this action. It was part of its strategy. My role was to give some input into how to achieve this. I asked what was this strategy based upon and an argument ensued. Needless to say, I didn’t make it past round one and was the very first to leave the competition. Mapping had failed on its second outing. So I carried on researching.
我立即开始绘制景观图，指出从通过处置此类实物资本到作为公用事业提供分销再到将打印能力重新定向到印刷电子产品中的机会和影响——“那些大型打印机有可能成为明天的英特尔我宣布！有很多机会，但在做出选择之前，我们需要更多地了解风景。我开始挖掘，询问有关用户、他们的需求以及我们对景观的了解的问题。我遇到了一堵沉默的墙，后面是 “这无关紧要” 这句话。该公司已经决定采取这一行动。这是其战略的一部分。我的职责是就如何实现这一目标提供一些意见。我问这个策略是基于什么，随后发生了争论。不用说，我没有通过第一轮，是第一个离开比赛的人。测绘在其第二次郊游中失败了。所以我继续研究。

It was at this time that I was also becoming quite well known in certain technology circles as a speaker on open source, web 2.0 and cloud computing. I kept being invited to more and more conferences and to present and discuss on technology changes within companies. I was flattered but quickly discovered that I needed to keep things simple. I was told the mapping concepts were just “too confusing” and so I restricted myself to talking about the impacts in more general terms. However, here I hit a snag. General concepts such as the world moving towards more utility provision of IT were often brushed aside for lacking any understanding of “real business” and the maps I needed to demonstrate why this would happen were considered “too confusing”. I felt increasingly trapped in a Paul Valéry paradox of “Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable”. I found myself sitting in rooms listening to conversations of the form: -
正是在这个时候，我作为开源、Web 2.0 和云计算方面的演讲者在某些技术圈子里也变得相当有名。我不断受邀参加越来越多的会议，并介绍和讨论公司内部的技术变革。我受宠若惊，但很快发现我需要让事情保持简单。有人告诉我，映射概念 “太混乱了”，所以我限制自己以更笼统的方式谈论影响。但是，在这里我遇到了障碍。诸如世界正朝着更多 IT 公用事业提供方向发展的一般概念经常因为缺乏对“真实业务” 的理解而被搁置一旁，而我需要展示为什么会发生这种情况的地图被认为“太混乱了”。我越来越觉得自己陷入了保罗 · 瓦莱里的悖论“一切简单都是错误的。一切复杂的东西都是无用的”。我发现自己坐在房间里听着以下形式的对话：-

CTO: “All the new servers are installed; systems are running fine”.
CTO：“所有的新服务器都安装好了；系统运行良好”。

CIO: “Excellent. Apparently the latest thing is cloud, hence I’ve asked Simon to come along. According to this business magazine then numerous successful companies are considering future pilots that might use it. We should look into it and whether it’s worth considering as part of our long term strategy.”
首席信息官：“非常好。显然最新的东西是云，因此我请西蒙一起来。根据这本商业杂志，许多成功的公司正在考虑未来可能使用它的飞行员。我们应该研究它，看看它是否值得作为我们长期战略的一部分来考虑。”

CTO: “We’ve already examined the subject. Cloud just means virtualisation of the data centre. The latest research I have says that virtualisation has entered the plateau of performance and provides an extremely efficient mechanism of infrastructure provision over our existing data centre technology. Our technology partners have virtualisation based products in this space that we should consider buying.”
CTO：“我们已经研究过这个问题。云只是意味着数据中心的虚拟化。我的最新研究表明，虚拟化已进入性能稳定期，并为我们现有的数据中心技术提供了一种极其有效的基础设施供应机制。我们的技术合作伙伴在这个领域拥有基于虚拟化的产品，我们应该考虑购买。”

CIO: “Excellent work. Well let’s look at getting this up and running. There’s some business interest and I’d like to tell the CEO we’ve been using cloud if it comes up in conversation. We don’t want to be left behind in this technology war. Any thoughts Simon?”
首席信息官：“出色的工作。好吧，让我们看看如何启动并运行它。有一些商业利益，如果谈话中提到云，我想告诉首席执行官我们一直在使用云。我们不想在这场技术战争中落后。西蒙有什么想法吗？

It sounded so simple but it was so wrong, my heart always sank. To explain why, I’m going to perform a mental translation that I started to do by converting IT speak into military speak. For some reason, I just find it becomes easier for people to understand.
听起来很简单，但大错特错，我的心总是往下沉。为了解释原因，我将开始通过将 IT 语言转换为军事语言来进行心理翻译。出于某种原因，我发现人们更容易理解它。

Captain: “All the new cannons arrived. We installed them and fired them this morning.”
船长：“所有的新大炮都到了。我们今天早上安装并解雇了他们。”

Colonel: “Excellent. Apparently the latest thing is bombing hills, hence I’ve asked Simon to come along. According to General’s weekly then numerous successful military leaders are considering future campaigns that might use it. We should look into it and whether it’s worth considering as part of our long term strategy.”
上校：“很好。显然最新的事情是轰炸山丘，因此我请西蒙一起来。据《将军周刊》报道，当时许多成功的军事领导人正在考虑可能使用它的未来战役。我们应该研究它，看看它是否值得作为我们长期战略的一部分来考虑。”

Captain: “We’ve already examined the subject. Bombing hills just means using mortars. The latest research I have says that mortars have entered the plateau of performance and provide an extremely efficient mechanism of killing compared to our existing technology. Our technology partners have mortar based products in this space that we should consider buying.”
机长：“我们已经研究过这个问题了。轰炸山丘只是意味着使用迫击炮。我的最新研究表明，与我们现有的技术相比，迫击炮已经进入了性能稳定期，并提供了一种极其有效的杀伤机制。我们的技术合作伙伴在这个领域拥有基于迫击炮的产品，我们应该考虑购买。”

Colonel: “Excellent work. Well let’s look at getting this up and running. There’s some military interest and I’d like to tell the general we’ve been bombing hills if it comes up in conversation. We don’t want to be left behind in this technology war. Any thoughts Simon?”
上校：“干得好。好吧，让我们看看如何启动并运行它。有一些军事利益，如果在谈话中出现，我想告诉将军我们一直在轰炸山丘。我们不想在这场技术战争中落后。西蒙有什么想法吗？

There seemed to be an overwhelming predilection towards copying others, technology faddism and buying pieces of kit rather than dealing with the problems at hand. There was no discussion of the users, the landscape or how it was changing. When I would raise how cloud was simply an evolution of an existing act from product to more industrialised utility models and as such it was more of change of business model rather than buying some tech … well, it was almost like I had spoken heresy in gobbledygook.
似乎有一种压倒性的偏好，即模仿他人、技术狂热和购买套件，而不是处理手头的问题。没有讨论用户、景观或它是如何变化的。当我提出云是如何简单地将现有行为从产品演变为更工业化的实用模型时，因此它更多的是商业模式的改变而不是购买一些技术…… 好吧，这几乎就像我在官方文章中所说的异端邪说.

Business and IT both seemed to be operating in an environment that they did not understand and often with an assumption that buying more high tech wins the day. But this is flawed. Low tech can be used to overcome a high tech opponent that has poor situational awareness. The U.S. Seventh Cavalry, with access to gatling guns and “hi-tech” weaponry suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn against bows, arrows and stone clubs. Occasionally I would let my guard down and deep dive into the topic thereby hitting the other side of Valéry’s paradox. Nearly every time I did this, I was dismissed by the simple question “what evidence do you have that evolution works in this way?”
业务和 IT 似乎都在一个他们不了解的环境中运作，并且常常假设购买更多的高科技产品会获胜。但这是有缺陷的。低科技可以用来战胜态势感知能力差的高科技对手。美国第七骑兵队拥有加特林机枪和 “高科技” 武器，在小大角河战役中因弓箭和石棍而惨败。偶尔我会放松警惕，深入探讨这个话题，从而触及瓦莱里悖论的另一面。几乎每次我这样做时，我都会被一个简单的问题打消：“你有什么证据表明进化是以这种方式进行的？”

Unbeknownst to me, I had just been given a new purpose by others. I had my own crusade, to explain topographical intelligence to the world of business and to provide an “uncommon sense to the common world of strategy”. It wasn’t quite as catchy as “Pre-shaved Yaks” but it became the title of my first failed attempt to write a book on mapping in 2007.
我不知道的是，别人刚刚给了我一个新的目标。我有自己的运动，向商业世界解释地形智能，并提供 “对战略的共同世界的非常识”。它不像“Pre-shaved Yaks” 那么吸引人，但它成为我在 2007 年第一次尝试写一本关于地图的书但失败的标题。

I needed to demonstrate or disprove the concept of evolution in technology and mapping itself. I had no clue on how to do this but that didn’t stop me becoming a bit obsessed. My beard grew longer and I’m pretty sure I was mumbling mapping in my sleep. The reason why my purpose became all-consuming was it had two other things that mattered. First, it had a defined scope that was tangible and could be understood i.e. I was looking at the validity of this mapping technique. Second, it also had a moral imperative, I was rebelling against the hordes of management consultants that enslaved us with 2x2s in this marriage of convenience! It felt good. I had: -
我需要证明或反驳技术和地图本身的进化概念。我不知道该怎么做，但这并没有阻止我变得有点着迷。我的胡子变长了，我很确定我在睡梦中喃喃自语。我的目标变得非常重要的原因是它还有另外两件事很重要。首先，它有一个明确的、有形的、可以理解的范围，即我正在研究这种映射技术的有效性。其次，它也有道德上的要求，我正在反抗成群结队的管理顾问，他们在这场权宜婚姻中用 2x2 奴役了我们！感觉很好。我有：-

Purpose: Explain topographical intelligence to the world of business.
目的：向商业世界解释地形智能。

Scope: Demonstrate or disprove the concept of evolution and mapping.
范围：论证或反驳进化和映射的概念。

Imperative: Rebel against the hordes of management consultants that enslave us by enabling ordinary people to learn.
势在必行：反抗成群结队的管理顾问，他们通过让普通人学习来奴役我们。

Being mindful of this purpose, I could now start thinking about the potential users of mapping and try to define what their needs might be. The users would need some way of exploiting mapping, some way of learning how to map given the complexity of the topic and also some sort of confirmation or validation that mapping was based upon something sensible. There was a chain of needs from purpose to user need (the very anchor of mapping) which I’ve drawn in figure 67.
考虑到这个目的，我现在可以开始考虑地图的潜在用户并尝试定义他们的需求。用户将需要某种利用映射的方法，某种学习如何在给定主题的复杂性的情况下进行映射的方法，以及某种确认或验证映射是基于某些合理的东西的方法。我在图 67 中绘制了从目的到用户需求（映射的真正锚点）的需求链。

Figure 67 — Purpose 图 67 — 目的


Given I had user needs then the very least I could do was map out that environment. Taking the user need of “Confidence that mapping can benefit us”from above then I’ve created a map of what is involved in figure 68. I’ll use this to describe some particular points on mapping itself. One thing you will notice is the x-axis that I’m using here is slightly different. Whilst I normally just use the descriptions for activities (genesis to commodity), in this case because we’re talking about knowledge then I’ll add those descriptions for the different stages of evolution. For more on the terms used when describing evolution see figure 10 (chapter 2).
考虑到我有用户需求，那么我至少可以做的就是规划出那个环境。根据上面的用户需求 “相信地图可以使我们受益”，我创建了图 68 中涉及的内容的地图。我将用它来描述地图本身的一些特定点。您会注意到的一件事是我在这里使用的 x 轴略有不同。虽然我通常只使用对活动的描述（从起源到商品），但在这种情况下，因为我们谈论的是知识，所以我会为不同的进化阶段添加这些描述。有关描述进化时使用的术语的更多信息，请参见图 10（第 2 章）。

Figure 68 — A map of mapping
图 68——映射图


From the map above; 从上面的地图；

Point 1 — From “confidence that mapping can benefit us” then we had two high level user needs which were a means to learn mapping and some form of validation.
第 1 点——从 “相信映射可以使我们受益”，我们有两个高级用户需求，即学习映射的方法和某种形式的验证。

Point 2 — learning mapping requires not only the ability to create a map of the landscape but to understand common economic patters, doctrine and even context specific gameplay. Whilst common economic patterns are often discussed in a multitude of economic sources, the issue of context specific gameplay is fairly unique and rarely covered.
第 2 点——学习制图不仅需要能够绘制地形图，还需要了解常见的经济模式、学说甚至特定背景下的游戏玩法。虽然常见的经济模式经常在众多经济资源中进行讨论，但特定于背景的游戏玩法的问题相当独特且很少涉及。

Point 3 — the map itself is based upon user needs (anchor) which is reasonably well discussed, a value chain (position) which itself is a common topic in business books but also evolution (movement). This last topic was rarely discussed back in 2007 other than in vague and hand waving notions. There were certainly concepts and competing hypothesis on how things evolved but no clear definitive path.
第 3 点——地图本身是基于用户需求（锚点），这是经过合理讨论的，价值链（位置）本身是商业书籍中的常见主题，也是进化（运动）。最后一个话题在 2007 年很少被讨论，除了模糊和挥手的概念。关于事物是如何演变的，当然有概念和相互竞争的假设，但没有明确的确定路径。

One of the first things that struck me was that there existed a chain of needs above my users. When I am a supplier of a component to others (e.g. providing nuts and bolts to a car manufacturer) then my map extends into their map. However, my map also extends into my own purpose and my own needs. In other words, any map is part of a wider chain of needs.
令我震惊的第一件事是，在我的用户之上存在着一系列需求。当我是其他人的组件供应商时（例如，向汽车制造商提供螺母和螺栓），我的地图就会延伸到他们的地图中。然而，我的地图也延伸到我自己的目的和我自己的需要。换句话说，任何地图都是更广泛的需求链的一部分。

In figure 69, I’ve drawn an extended map from my purpose and my needs through to my user and their needs. I’ve reverted back to the more typical x-axis because you should be familiar that multiple types (activities, practices, data and knowledge) can be used on a map and it makes it less busy to just to show evolution terms for activities rather than all.
在图 69 中，我绘制了一张从我的目的和我的需求到我的用户和他们的需求的扩展图。我已经恢复到更典型的 x 轴，因为您应该熟悉可以在地图上使用多种类型（活动、实践、数据和知识），这使得仅显示活动的演变术语变得不那么忙比所有。

Figure 69 — The chain 图 69 — 链条


From the map above; 从上面的地图；

Point 1 — we have my needs i.e. my purpose, my scope and my moral imperative. This is my why of purpose expressed as a chain of needs e.g. be the world’s best tea shop or teach everyone to map. Naturally, I’d hope that my purpose would lead to others doing something and hence there would be users. In 2007, my scope was relatively novel as few seemed to be talking about mapping. However, my imperative wasn’t quite so unique. There were many rallying against the imposed consultancy industry.
第 1 点——我们有我的需求，即我的目的、我的范围和我的道德要求。这就是我为什么将目的表达为一系列需求，例如成为世界上最好的茶馆或教大家绘制地图。自然地，我希望我的目的会导致其他人做某事，因此会有用户。 2007 年，我的范围相对较新，因为似乎很少有人在谈论映射。然而，我的命令并不是那么独特。有许多反对强加的咨询业的集会。

Point 2 — whilst I hadn’t expressed this before, I had an unwritten need to survive, to make revenue and a profit. This is a very common and well understood need. In my case, I hoped that I could achieve this by meeting my users’ needs of either teaching them how to map or helping them create advantage over others.
第 2 点——虽然我之前没有表达过这一点，但我有一种不成文的生存需求，为了赚取收入和利润。这是一个非常普遍且易于理解的需求。就我而言，我希望我可以通过满足用户的需求来实现这一目标，即教他们如何绘制地图或帮助他们创造优势。

Point 3 — my users had needs themselves. If my needs (i.e. purpose) didn’t fit in some way with the needs of my users, then this mismatch was likely to cause problems. For example, if my highest purpose was to make profit rather than explain topographical intelligence, then I would be focusing on extracting money from my users (this is not one of their core needs) rather than providing a means of learning mapping and creating advantage (which is a core user need). You should always strive to generate revenue and profit as a direct consequence of meeting users’ needs and providing value to them.
第 3 点——我的用户自己有需求。如果我的需求（即目的）在某种程度上不符合我的用户的需求，那么这种不匹配很可能会导致问题。例如，如果我的最高目标是盈利而不是解释地形智能，那么我将专注于从我的用户那里榨取金钱（这不是他们的核心需求之一）而不是提供一种学习制图和创造优势的手段（这是核心用户需求）。作为满足用户需求并为他们提供价值的直接结果，您应该始终努力创造收入和利润。

There are few other subtler things worth noting about the map above. First, my purpose is part of a chain of needs and as such it is influenced by the underlying components as they evolve. Over time, if mapping and the related activities become more industrialised then a scope of “demonstrate the concepts of evolution and mapping” ceases to be relevant. Even my moral imperative might disappear if the world becomes one where everyone maps, learns about their environment and has rebelled against management consultants with their 2x2s. If you think back to the strategy cycle, this is simply a reflection of the issue that as you act, as your landscape changes then your purpose, scope, moral imperative and even how you survive have to adapt. Nothing is permanent.
关于上面的地图，几乎没有其他值得注意的微妙之处。首先，我的目的是需求链的一部分，因此它会随着底层组件的发展而受到影响。随着时间的推移，如果制图和相关活动变得更加工业化，那么 “展示进化和制图概念” 的范围就不再相关。如果世界变成一个每个人都绘制地图、了解他们的环境并用他们的 2x2 反抗管理顾问的世界，甚至我的道德要求也可能消失。如果你回想一下战略周期，这只是一个问题的反映，随着你的行动，随着你的环境发生变化，你的目的、范围、道德要求甚至你的生存方式都必须适应。没有什么是永恒的。

The second thing to note is that everything is evolving. At some point in the future, I will need to adapt my scope not only because the underlying components have evolved but also that my scope has become industrialised. There would be a point that you will be able to read endless free guides on how to map and even wikipedia articles. If at that point might scope isn’t something else designed to meet users’ needs and provide value to them then I’ll be attempting to survive against free.
第二要注意的是，一切都在发展。在未来的某个时候，我需要调整我的范围，不仅因为底层组件已经发展，而且我的范围已经工业化。有一点你将能够阅读关于如何绘制地图甚至维基百科文章的无穷无尽的免费指南。如果那时范围不是为了满足用户需求并为他们提供价值而设计的其他东西，那么我将尝试与免费竞争生存。

The final issue is the balancing act between different user needs. I thought I had learned that lesson in my past doomed attempt to build a platform future by ignoring one set of very powerful users (the board) but I repeated the same mistake in my strategy consultancy interview. I was trying to engage in a discussion on the environment whereas they needed a financial and HR analysis of impacts caused by a disposal. Whether it was the right or wrong decision wasn’t something they cared about and I wasn’t thinking about their needs. Any play I created may have been right but without support of these users then it didn’t matter.
最后一个问题是不同用户需求之间的平衡。我以为我在过去通过忽略一组非常强大的用户（董事会）来建立平台未来的注定失败的尝试中吸取了教训，但我在战略咨询面试中重复了同样的错误。我试图参与有关环境的讨论，而他们需要对处置造成的影响进行财务和人力资源分析。他们不关心这个决定是对还是错，我也没有考虑他们的需求。我创建的任何游戏可能都是正确的，但如果没有这些用户的支持，那就没关系了。

The Hypothetical Gun company 假设的枪支公司
This concept of conflict between user needs is worth exploring a bit more. Let us take a trawl back through time and imagine you’re the boss of a hypothetical gun company just when the market is learning how to industrialise mechanical components. We’re moving away from the world of highly customised mechanical components built by a cottage industry to having things like more uniform pipes and bolts. Let us imagine that you’ve taken a bold move and started to buy more standard bolts and pipes (for barrels). You then use these components in the manufacture of your guns by combining them with your skills and practice as gunsmiths. I’ve highlighted this in a map in figure 70. Remember, it’s a hypothetical and I’ve no idea how to actually make a gun.
这种用户需求之间的冲突概念值得进一步探讨。让我们回顾一下过去，假设您是一家假想的枪支公司的老板，而此时市场正在学习如何将机械部件工业化。我们正在摆脱由家庭手工业制造的高度定制的机械部件的世界，转向拥有更统一的管道和螺栓等东西。让我们想象一下，您采取了大胆的举措并开始购买更多标准螺栓和管道（用于桶）。然后，通过将这些组件与您作为枪械匠的技能和实践相结合，您可以在制造枪支时使用这些组件。我在图 70 的地图中突出显示了这一点。请记住，这是一个假设，我不知道如何实际制造枪支。

Figure 70 — The hypothetical gun company
图 70——假设的枪支公司


You are the gun company (point 1) and you’re reliant upon bolts (point 2) from a company that manufactures them (point 3). The first thing to note is that a map can cover many different organisations if you wish. Each of those organisations could be expanded into, providing more detail. When you map an environment then you’re only ever looking at a fraction of a vast chain of needs. Hence the importance of defining a scope that is tangible rather than attempting to create a perfect map of an entire industry right down to every knob and whistle. You will learn over time how to simplify maps but to begin with, keep your ambitions small. Think small! As in know the details (see chapter 4, doctrine).
你是枪支公司（第 1 点），你依赖制造它们的公司（第 3 点）的螺栓（第 2 点）。首先要注意的是，如果您愿意，地图可以涵盖许多不同的组织。这些组织中的每一个都可以扩展到，提供更多细节。当您绘制环境图时，您只会看到庞大需求链中的一小部分。因此，重要的是定义一个有形的范围，而不是试图为整个行业创建一个完美的地图，直到每个旋钮和哨子。随着时间的推移，您将学习如何简化地图，但首先要保持小规模。想小！如了解详情（见第 4 章，学说）。

In the above, I’ve highlighted that guns are evolving and heading towards more of a commodity. This can create conflict with your own desire to survive and your shareholders desire for profit as the revenue per unit decreases. Such change can be compensated by volume but the desire is always to keep the same margin but increase units. We almost want the thing to become ubiquitous but seen as unique. There are ways of achieving this through branding and persuading others that your “commodity” is somehow special. It’s not a rock, it’s a “pet rock” as Gary Dahl might say. Alternatively you can bundle new features or characteristics onto it. It’s not just a gun, it’s special gun that makes you popular or it’s a vacuum that doesn’t look suction!
在上文中，我强调枪支正在发展并朝着更多的商品方向发展。随着每单位收入的减少，这可能会与您自己的生存愿望和您的股东对利润的愿望产生冲突。这种变化可以通过数量来补偿，但希望始终保持相同的利润但增加单位。我们几乎希望事物变得无处不在，但又被视为独一无二。有多种方法可以通过品牌推广和说服他人您的 “商品” 在某种程度上很特别。这不是一块石头，正如加里达尔所说，它是一块“宠物石头”。或者，您可以将新功能或特性捆绑到它上面。它不仅仅是一把枪，它是让你受欢迎的特殊枪或者它是一个看起来不吸力的真空吸尘器！

At the same time your gun is becoming a commodity (something you may not want) then you do want the components that you consume in manufacturing your gun to become more commodity like. This will obviously reduce your cost. However, the shareholders of the bolt company would like to have volume operations but maintain the margin per unit. They’ll be hoping their management use branding to try and persuade you that their “commodity” is somehow special. It’s not just a bolt, it’s a special bolt that makes you popular with others or doesn’t lose suction! There will inherently be conflict between different types of users (whether customers, the business, shareholders or regulators) throughout the landscape.
同时，您的枪支正在成为商品（您可能不想要的东西），那么您确实希望制造枪支时消耗的组件变得更像商品。这显然会降低您的成本。但是，螺栓公司的股东希望进行批量操作，但要保持单位利润率。他们会希望他们的管理层使用品牌来试图说服你他们的 “商品” 在某种程度上是特别的。它不仅仅是一个螺栓，它是一种特殊的螺栓，可以让你受到别人的欢迎或者不会失去吸力！在整个环境中，不同类型的用户（无论是客户、企业、股东还是监管机构）之间必然会存在冲突。

But that conflict doesn’t even require another person. Your own purpose can create its own conflict when faced with an evolving landscape. Take for example my map of mapping above (figure 69). My moral imperative was to rebel against the hordes of consultants that enslave us. By definition I wanted mapping to spread far and wide. But as mapping spreads then my ability to make revenue from teaching others how to map will ultimately diminish especially as basic guides on mapping become free. I could either pursue a path of “it’s not just a map, it’s a special map that makes you popular with others” or I would have to find another way of surviving e.g. selling context specific forms of gameplay rather than just teaching people how to map.
但这种冲突甚至不需要另一个人。当面对不断变化的环境时，您自己的目标可能会产生自己的冲突。以我上面的映射图为例（图 69）。我的道德责任是反抗成群结队的奴役我们的顾问。根据定义，我希望地图能够广泛传播。但是随着制图的普及，我通过教别人如何制图来赚钱的能力最终会减少，尤其是当基本的制图指南变得免费时。我要么走 “这不仅仅是一张地图，它是一张让你受到他人欢迎的特殊地图” 的道路，要么我必须找到另一种生存方式，例如。销售特定于上下文的游戏形式，而不仅仅是教人们如何绘制地图。

Fortunately, context specific forms of gameplay aren’t just one thing. If I taught people how to exploit ecosystems with an ILC model (see chapter 5), then I should expect that model to become industrialised over time. However, mapping is itself a means of exploring and learning about new forms of context specific gameplay i.e. there should be a constant pipeline of new forms of gameplay as long as we are willing to learn.
幸运的是，特定于上下文的游戏玩法形式不仅仅是一回事。如果我教人们如何利用 ILC 模型（见第 5 章）开发生态系统，那么我应该期望该模型随着时间的推移实现工业化。然而，映射本身是一种探索和学习新形式的特定上下文游戏玩法的方法，即只要我们愿意学习，就应该有一个持续不断的新形式的游戏玩法管道。

I’ve drawn this map up in figure 71 below. Whilst teaching mapping will ultimately industrialise (point 1) there is also a constant pipeline of gameplay (point 2) with new forms of gameplay emerging. I could create a business, with a strong purpose and though it would have to adapt as components changed, there would be other opportunities for me to exploit. Even if I open sourced the mapping method to encourage it to spread (which I did by making it all creative commons) then I knew that I could create a future as an “arms dealer” of gameplay.
我在下面的图 71 中绘制了这张地图。虽然教学地图最终将工业化（第 1 点），但随着新形式的游戏玩法的出现，游戏玩法也会不断涌现（第 2 点）。我可以创建一个有强烈目标的企业，虽然它必须随着组件的变化而适应，但我还有其他机会可以利用。即使我开源了映射方法以鼓励它传播（我通过将其全部设为创意共享来做到这一点），我也知道我可以创造一个未来作为游戏玩法的 “军火商”。

There was a weakness however to this plan caused by point 3. The whole play would depend upon some sort of validation of mapping and at that time, I had nothing to back up my evolution axis, no success stories and no volume of users. I also needed users with success stories to entice other users because like it or not, the mantra of “67% of other generals bomb hills, I should learn to bomb a hill” dominates our industry. It was a chicken and the egg moment (p.s. the answer is egg) and I had nothing to encourage someone to try.
然而，由于第 3 点，该计划存在一个弱点。整个过程将取决于某种映射验证，那时，我没有任何东西可以支持我的进化轴，没有成功案例，也没有用户量。我还需要有成功故事的用户来吸引其他用户，因为不管喜欢与否，“67% 的其他将军轰炸山丘，我应该学会轰炸一座山丘” 的口头禅在我们的行业中占据主导地位。这是先有鸡还是先有蛋的时刻（附注：答案是先有蛋），我没有什么可以鼓励别人尝试的。

I had to find some way of either showing the evolution scale had merit or disprove it and hence get on with my life. I thought this was going to be easy. I couldn’t have been more wrong.
我必须找到某种方法来证明进化量表的价值或反驳它，从而继续我的生活。我以为这会很容易。我大错特错了。

In his 1962 book on the Diffusion of Innovation, Everett Rogers explained a theory of how new technology spreads through cultures. These innovations are communicated over time through various social structures from early adopters to late adopters (or laggards) and are consequently either spread through adoption or rejected in a society. This spread is measured using adoption versus time through what are known as diffusion curves. As Rogers’ noted, not all innovation spreads: even where an innovation has apparent usefulness, a number of factors can influence its adoption. In 1991, Geoffrey Moore refined these concepts and noted that there was a chasm between the early adopters of an innovation and the early majority. Many innovations failed to cross this chasm. Numerous effects would impact the probability that the chasm would be crossed from positioning of the product to its target market to distribution channels to product pricing and even to marketing.
埃弗里特 · 罗杰斯 (Everett Rogers) 在他 1962 年出版的关于创新扩散的书中解释了新技术如何通过文化传播的理论。随着时间的推移，这些创新通过从早期采用者到晚期采用者（或落后者）的各种社会结构进行交流，因此要么通过采用传播，要么在社会中被拒绝。这种传播是通过所谓的扩散曲线使用采用与时间的关系来衡量的。正如罗杰斯所指出的，并非所有的创新都会传播：即使创新具有明显的用途，许多因素也会影响其采用。 1991 年，杰弗里 · 摩尔 (Geoffrey Moore) 完善了这些概念，并指出创新的早期采用者与早期大多数人之间存在鸿沟。许多创新未能跨越这个鸿沟。从产品定位到目标市场，再到分销渠道，再到产品定价，甚至营销，跨越鸿沟的可能性有许多影响。

Before we continue, there’s often some confusion between diffusion curves and Moore’s presentation of this. I don’t know why, one is purely the sum of the other.
在我们继续之前，扩散曲线和摩尔对此的介绍之间经常存在一些混淆。不知道为什么，一个纯粹是另一个的总和。

Figure 72 — Diffusion curves and Moore’s crossing the chasm
图 72 — 扩散曲线和摩尔跨越鸿沟


It seemed self-obvious to me at that time that if something diffused, crossing the chasm on the way to the mass majority then it would become more of a commodity. All I had to do was find at what percentage of adoption did things on a diffusion curve start to evolve i.e. at what percentage did it become a product or a commodity? — see figure 73.
当时对我来说似乎不言而喻，如果某种东西扩散开来，在通往大众的道路上跨越鸿沟，那么它就会变得更像是一种商品。我所要做的就是找出扩散曲线上的事物在多大比例的采用下开始演变，即它在多大比例下成为产品或商品？ ——见图 73。

Figure 73 — When does a diffusing thing evolve?
图 73 — 扩散性事物何时演化？


Unfortunately, as simple as it sounded, any analysis of data shows that figure 73 is just plain wrong. You cannot take a diffusion curve and slap on evolution. If you take something like a smartphone and ask people whether it’s a product or more of a commodity, then today you’ll probably get a range of answers and some disagreement. However, there are more smart phones in the US than people, so we can say it’s widely diffused despite a lack of clarity over whether it’s a product or a commodity. But, if I ask people whether a gold bar is a commodity then they’ll say yes. This is bizarre because only a tiny fraction of the population actually own gold bars. On one hand, you have a thing which is diffused but not a commodity whilst on the other hand you have something which is uncommon but is a commodity.
不幸的是，尽管听起来很简单，但任何数据分析都表明图 73 是完全错误的。您不能采用扩散曲线并拍打进化。如果你拿着智能手机之类的东西问人们它是产品还是商品，那么今天你可能会得到各种各样的答案和一些不同意见。然而，美国的智能手机数量比人多，所以我们可以说它已经广泛传播，尽管它是一种产品还是一种商品尚不清楚。但是，如果我问人们金条是否是商品，他们会说是。这很奇怪，因为只有一小部分人真正拥有金条。一方面，你有一种被传播但不是商品的东西，而另一方面你有一些不常见但是商品的东西。

I spent months collecting diffusion curves for different activities and found there was no clear correlation between a percentage of adoption and when something evolved. I was unable to make statements such as “when 10% of the population have this it’ll become a product”. Hence, I looked at the time axis. Surely, if it wasn’t adoption then we must be able to measure this evolution over time? I took the diffusion curves and hypothesised that we could measure over time when the transition between stages would occur e.g. the first five years would be genesis and in the next three years we would see custom built examples. However, when looking at the data then it turned out not to be constant and comparisons over time demonstrate a wide variety of different timescales for how things evolved. I was stuck. I couldn’t seem to use time or adoption to measure evolution.
我花了几个月的时间收集不同活动的传播曲线，发现采用百分比与某些事物的发展时间之间没有明显的相关性。我无法做出诸如 “当 10% 的人拥有它时它就会成为一种产品” 之类的陈述。因此，我查看了时间轴。当然，如果不是采用，那么我们必须能够随着时间的推移衡量这种演变？我采用扩散曲线并假设我们可以随时间测量阶段之间的过渡何时发生，例如前五年将是创世纪，在接下来的三年中，我们将看到定制的例子。然而，当查看数据时，事实证明它并不是恒定的，并且随着时间的推移进行的比较表明，事情的演变有多种不同的时间尺度。我卡住了。我似乎无法用时间或收养来衡量进化。

To make matters worse I was in the middle of a very visible evolution of computing infrastructure from products (e.g. servers) to more utility forms (cloud). The very companies that could be described as early adopters of computing when it was a product were often the laggards in this shift to a utility world. The act of computing was the same though it was now provided in a more evolved form and the social groups leading this change were different from the past. The simplistic association of diffusion and evolution was clearly failing to explain what was happening right in front of me.
更糟糕的是，我正处于计算基础设施从产品（例如服务器）到更多实用形式（云）的非常明显的演变过程中。那些在计算作为产品时可以被描述为早期采用者的公司往往是向公用事业世界转变的落后者。计算的行为是相同的，尽管它现在以更进化的形式提供，并且领导这种变化的社会群体与过去不同。扩散和进化的简单关联显然无法解释发生在我面前的事情。

Even today, in 2016, some nine years later then I still see “business gurus” take diffusion curves and start slapping on evolution characteristics. Here it’s “innovation” and here it’s a “commodity”. I tend to ask them to demonstrate this and I get the usual reply of “well, it’s obvious”. Alas, it’s not and the “it’s obvious” turns out to be unsubstantiated. If you’re feeling evil then you can test this yourself. Just ask “How many years from innovation to commodity” and they’ll normally reply “it’s variable”. Then ask “At what % adoption does something become a commodity?” and they’ll normally reply “it’s variable”. Then ask “well, if it’s variable in terms of time and adoption then how have you put a marker on a graph of time and adoption?” … this should make a suitably uncomfortable moment. It’s not that these gurus are daft but instead it’s incredibly easy to fall into that “well, it’s obvious” state of mind.
即使在 2016 年的今天，大约九年后，我仍然看到 “商业大师” 采用扩散曲线并开始抨击进化特征。这里是 “创新”，这里是“商品”。我倾向于要求他们证明这一点，而我通常会得到“好吧，这很明显” 的回答。 las，事实并非如此，而且 “很明显” 被证明是没有根据的。如果你感觉不好，那么你可以自己测试一下。只要问 “从创新到商品多少年”，他们通常会回答“它是可变的”。然后问“某物在多大程度上成为商品？” 他们通常会回答 “它是可变的”。然后问“好吧，如果它在时间和采用方面是可变的，那么你如何在时间和采用图表上放置标记？” …… 这应该是一个相当不舒服的时刻。并不是说这些大师愚蠢，而是很容易陷入“好吧，这很明显” 的心态。

Back in 2007, my problem was that I had also been lulled into the same confident belief that we somehow understood the process of change and it was “obvious”. The popular view tends to be that innovations appear somewhat randomly, either through the efforts of a group of people or often by happenstance e.g. a fortuitous accident such as the discovery of inkjets through the placing of a hot syringe in a well of ink. These innovations then diffuse as above, some succeeding and crossing the chasm whilst others fail. We often have competing examples — AC vs. DC electricity or BetaMax vs. VHS — until one becomes more established and dominant. Over time, the same innovation becomes a commodity. It feels simple and logical.
回到 2007 年，我的问题是我也被哄骗到同样的自信信念，即我们以某种方式理解变化的过程并且它是 “显而易见的”。流行的观点往往是，创新的出现有些随机，要么是通过一群人的努力，要么通常是偶然的，例如偶然的事故，例如通过将热注射器放入墨水池中发现喷墨打印机。这些创新然后像上面那样传播，一些成功并跨越了鸿沟，而另一些则失败了。我们经常有相互竞争的例子——交流电与直流电或 BetaMax 与 VHS——直到其中一个变得更加成熟和占主导地位。随着时间的推移，同样的创新成为一种商品。感觉简单而合乎逻辑。

However, the rate of diffusion is not constant and we cannot measure the change of evolution over adoption or time. Furthermore, whatever process was occurring was not always continuous. As highlighted by Christensen’s work on disruptive innovation, an existing industry can be disrupted by the introduction of a new technology that offers different performance attributes from those established. In other words, the diffusion of one thing can be substituted for another. For example, hydraulic excavators disrupted cable excavators and its associated suppliers. However, the same process could also be continuous. These innovations could be improving and sustaining e.g. a better car, a better phone, a better computer or a more efficient means of steel manufacturing such as the Bessemer convertor.
然而，传播速度不是恒定的，我们无法衡量进化随采用或时间的变化。此外，无论发生什么过程并不总是连续的。正如克里斯滕森在颠覆性创新方面的工作所强调的那样，现有行业可能会因引入新技术而被颠覆，该新技术提供与现有行业不同的性能属性。换句话说，一种事物的扩散可以替代另一种事物。例如，液压挖掘机扰乱了电缆挖掘机及其相关供应商。然而，同样的过程也可以是连续的。这些创新可能正在改善和维持，例如。更好的汽车、更好的电话、更好的计算机或更高效的钢铁制造手段，例如贝塞默转炉。

It seemed that organisations were competing in an ecosystem with others and the desire to differentiate was driving the creation of innovations that diffuse forcing all companies to adapt (the Red Queen effect, chapter 3). The innovations themselves appear somewhat randomly, often by fortuitous accident and whilst some innovations disrupt, others will sustain. Furthermore, the innovations themselves might be novel or represent an incremental improvement to some past innovation e.g. a better car rather than the first car. The process of diffusion itself is complex, changing in terms of the rate of diffusion and has pitfalls such as the chasm. Given this complexity, how could I hope to describe a process of evolution?
组织似乎在一个生态系统中与其他组织竞争，差异化的愿望正在推动创新的产生，这些创新扩散迫使所有公司进行调整（红皇后效应，第 3 章）。创新本身有些随机出现，通常是偶然的事故，虽然有些创新会破坏，但其他创新会持续下去。此外，创新本身可能是新颖的或代表对某些过去创新的渐进式改进，例如比第一辆车更好的车。扩散过程本身是复杂的，随着扩散速率的变化而变化，并且存在诸如鸿沟之类的陷阱。鉴于这种复杂性，我怎么能希望描述一个进化过程呢？

With such an environment, how could any CEO be anything but bewildered and lost by the apparent randomness of competition? Where will the next great innovation appear? Will it be sustaining or a disruptive change? How quickly will it spread? Will it not spread? Will it jump the chasm? Will it impact me? Should we be early adopters or not? Is it any wonder that our ability to predict the future is often lamentable? Is it any surprise that given the fluid nature of our environment we are reduced to hoping to keep afloat by catching the latest wave of change? Is it really that shocking that in practice we’re forced to copy what others are doing, to go with the market as we all swarm around new concepts?
在这样的环境下，任何 CEO 怎么可能不被竞争的明显随机性所迷惑和迷失呢？下一个伟大的创新将出现在哪里？它是持续性的还是破坏性的变化？它传播的速度有多快？不会扩散吗？它会跨越鸿沟吗？它会影响我吗？我们是否应该成为早期采用者？我们预测未来的能力常常令人遗憾，这有什么奇怪的吗？考虑到我们环境的流动性，我们不得不希望通过捕捉最新的变化浪潮来维持生计，这有什么奇怪的吗？在实践中，当我们都涌入新概念时，我们被迫复制其他人正在做的事情，以跟随市场，这真的令人震惊吗？

All of these thoughts were swirling through my mind as I looked at that evolution axis of genesis, custom, product and commodity on map. It seemed so simple. I had obviously been seduced by this. But it seemed to work! I could find no evidence to support this pattern. I had probably wasted months trying to solve an impossible problem. Help!!!
当我看着地图上的起源、习俗、产品和商品的进化轴时，所有这些想法都在我脑海中盘旋。看起来很简单。我显然被这个诱惑了。但它似乎工作！我找不到任何证据支持这种模式。我可能已经浪费了几个月的时间试图解决一个不可能的问题。帮助！！！

That first question 第一个问题
The standard model I’ve outlined contains the random appearance of innovation, different rates of diffusion and both sustaining and disruptive change. Whilst it sounds simple, it it is hopelessly complex in practice. It was probably a day or two after I had decided that this was probably a lost cause that I thought of the first question that I needed to ask. What actually constitutes an innovation?
我概述的标准模型包含随机出现的创新、不同的传播速度以及持续性和破坏性的变化。虽然这听起来很简单，但在实践中却是极其复杂的。大概一两天后，我决定这可能是一个失败的原因，我想到了我需要问的第一个问题。什么才是真正的创新？

Whether something is an innovation or not partially depends upon the perspective of the observer. Hence, the Bessemer convertor was a process improvement to iron and steel manufacturers but a product innovation to suppliers of equipment for those industries. Equally, the modern day provision of computing resources through large utility suppliers (such as Amazon’s EC2 service) is certainly a new business model for those suppliers but for its consumers then the use of computing resources in business is hardly new.
某事是否是创新部分取决于观察者的视角。因此，Bessemer 转炉对钢铁制造商来说是一种工艺改进，但对这些行业的设备供应商来说是一种产品创新。同样，现代通过大型公用事业供应商（如亚马逊的 EC2 服务）提供计算资源对于这些供应商来说无疑是一种新的商业模式，但对于消费者而言，在商业中使用计算资源并不是什么新鲜事。

Jan Fagerberg defined innovation as the “first attempt to put an idea into practice”. Unfortunately, this equally applies to something novel or a feature improvement or a new business model for an existing activity. However, is a feature improvement to a phone really the same as the creation of the first phone? Is this equivalent to the introduction of rental service for phones? They are all called innovations but are they really the same or are we using one word to describe many different types of change? Maybe this was the confusion? I was looking at the diffusion of innovations but maybe we were talking about diffusion of different types of innovation?
Jan Fagerberg 将创新定义为 “将想法付诸实践的第一次尝试”。不幸的是，这同样适用于现有活动的新事物或功能改进或新业务模型。然而，手机的功能改进真的等同于第一部手机的诞生吗？这是否等同于引入电话租赁服务？它们都被称为创新，但它们真的是一样的吗？还是我们用一个词来描述许多不同类型的变化？也许这就是混乱？我正在研究创新的扩散，但也许我们在谈论不同类型创新的扩散？

Somehow, in a mad frenzy of writing on whiteboards, I connected three pieces of information to challenge my view of random and equivalent innovation impacting across society. Rogers and Kincaid in “Towards a new Paradigm of Research” published the first piece of the puzzle in 1981. When examining continuous and sustaining technological innovation, they noted that the rate of improvement tends to be slow and then accelerates until reaching a plateau of a more mature and slow improving stage. Each improved version increasingly adds definition, eventually providing something that can be considered feature complete, mature and generally well understood. The insight here is that the maturing of a technology requires multiple improved versions with each reducing uncertainty about the technology.
不知何故，在疯狂地在白板上书写时，我将三条信息联系起来，以挑战我对影响整个社会的随机和等效创新的看法。罗杰斯和金凯德在 “走向新的研究范式” 中于 1981 年发表了第一块拼图。比较成熟和缓慢完善的阶段。每个改进的版本都增加了定义，最终提供了一些可以被认为是功能完整、成熟且普遍易于理解的东西。这里的见解是，一项技术的成熟需要多个改进版本，每个版本都减少了该技术的不确定性。

The second piece of the puzzle was published in 1996 by Paul Strassmann, a great and often under acknowledged economist. In “The value of computers, information & knowledge”, Strassmann showed that within business there was no correlation between IT spending and the value it created for the business. The work demonstrated that IT wasn’t one thing but instead consisted of many activities. The insight here is that organisations consist of multiple components some of which create value whilst others did not.
谜题的第二块由保罗 · 斯特拉斯曼 (Paul Strassmann) 于 1996 年发表，他是一位伟大的经济学家，但他的知名度却往往不高。在 “计算机、信息和知识的价值” 一文中，斯特拉斯曼表明，在企业内部，IT 支出与其为企业创造的价值之间没有相关性。这项工作表明 IT 不是一回事，而是由许多活​​动组成。这里的见解是，组织由多个组件组成，其中一些组件创造价值，而其他组件则没有。

The third piece was a Harvard Business Review paper, “Does IT Matter”, published by Nicholas Carr in 2003. This paper discussed the IT industry and demonstrated that as certain aspects of IT became widespread and common they had diminishing differential value and became more of a cost of doing business.
第三篇文章是哈佛商业评论的一篇论文，“IT 重要吗”，由 Nicholas Carr 于 2003 年发表。这篇论文讨论了 IT 行业，并证明随着 IT 的某些方面变得普遍和普遍，它们的差异价值逐渐减少，并变得越来越重要做生意的成本。

In isolation the three pieces were interesting to note but in combination they implied something remarkable but obvious in hindsight about how activities (i.e. the things we do) change.
单独来看，这三件作品很有趣，但结合起来，它们暗示了一些值得注意但事后看来很明显的事情，即活动（即我们所做的事情）是如何改变的。

Activities evolved through multiple improving versions.
活动通过多个改进版本演变而来。
Activities were not uniform; any system could contain multiple components which were at different stages of evolution i.e. there was no “IT” but a mass of components that made “IT”.
活动不统一；任何系统都可以包含多个处于不同发展阶段的组件，即没有 “IT”，而是大量组件构成了 “IT”。
The characteristics of activities changed as they evolved; as they became more commonplace they had diminishing differential value, became more of a cost of doing business and more certain. The improving versions of the same activity would have different characteristics.
活动的特征随着它们的发展而变化；随着它们变得越来越普遍，它们的差异价值越来越小，越来越成为做生意的成本，也越来越确定。同一活动的改进版本将具有不同的特征。
These seemed to imply that climatic patterns I had noticed were occurring but somehow I just couldn’t get evolution to fit with diffusion. I felt that I must be wrong. Then, I started to realise that maybe these two processes are related but separate.
这些似乎暗示我注意到的气候模式正在发生，但不知何故我就是无法让进化适应扩散。我觉得我一定是错的。然后，我开始意识到这两个过程可能相关但又是分开的。

Maybe I had just got stuck on trying to tie diffusion of innovation to evolution? What if instead, evolution consisted of multiple waves of diffusion e.g. the diffusion of the first innovation of the act followed by waves of diffusions of improving innovations? Maybe those waves were different? An examination of historical records clearly showed that technological change tends to mature through multiple waves of diffusion of ever-improved versions. The pattern of evolution was there and I had collected a wealth of data over the years which suggested it. I just had to break out of the shackles of diffusion.
也许我只是坚持尝试将创新的扩散与进化联系起来？相反，如果进化是由多波扩散组成的，例如该法案的第一个创新的扩散之后是改进创新的扩散浪潮？也许那些波是不同的？对历史记录的审查清楚地表明，技术变革往往会通过不断改进版本的多次传播浪潮而走向成熟。进化模式就在那里，多年来我收集了大量数据来证明这一点。我只需要摆脱扩散的束缚。

I started to think in terms of multiple diffusion curves. Let us take an activity, we shall call it A — it could be television or the telephone, it doesn’t matter. Now let us assume this activity will evolve through several versions — A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5. Each version might be disruptive or sustaining to the previous and each will diffuse on its own diffusion curve — see figure 74.
我开始考虑多重扩散曲线。让我们进行一项活动，我们将其称为 A——它可以是电视或电话，没关系。现在让我们假设这项活动将通过几个版本发展——A1、A2、A3、A4 和 A5。每个版本都可能对前一个版本具有破坏性或持续性，并且每个版本都将按照自己的扩散曲线扩散——见图 74。

Figure 74 — evolution through multiple waves of diffusion.
图 74——通过多波扩散的演变。


Whilst each version of the act diffuses to 100% adoption of its market, those applicable markets could be different sizes for different versions. Hence the market for the first phones might not be the same market for later, more evolved phones. The time for diffusion of each version could also be different.
虽然该法案的每个版本都扩散到其市场的 100% 采用率，但这些适用市场对于不同的版本可能具有不同的规模。因此，第一款手机的市场可能与后来更先进的手机的市场不同。每个版本的传播时间也可能不同。

I had been assuming that by looking at adoption in a population then we could determine how evolved something was because of how “ubiquitous” it had become. This idea had come from concepts that commodity was commonplace. But what if the applicable markets were fundamentally different? Maybe ubiquity for gold bars meant 2% of the total population owning them whereas ubiquity of smart phone meant everyone owns three of them? I couldn’t just measure adoption because there could be a bigger market just around the corner. What I needed to do was measure was adoption in its ‘ubiquitous’ market. But was it that? How do I calculate it?
我一直在假设，通过观察人群中的收养情况，我们可以确定某物是如何进化的，因为它已经变得 “无处不在”。这个想法来自商品是司空见惯的概念。但是，如果适用的市场根本不同呢？也许金条的普及意味着拥有它们的总人口的 2%，而智能手机的普及意味着每个人都拥有三个？我不能只衡量采用率，因为可能会有更大的市场指日可待。我需要做的是衡量其在“无处不在” 的市场中的采用情况。但就是这样吗？我如何计算它？

By pure serendipity, it was just at this time that I stumbled upon the Stacey Matrix. This is a mechanism for classifying types of agreements between groups. At one extreme, you had groups that were far from agreement with high levels of uncertainty; this was the domain of chaos and anarchy. At the other extreme you had groups that were close to agreement with high degrees of certainty, the domain of simple. What struck me with the Stacey Matrix (see figure 75) was the polar opposite nature of the domains and how the language was not dissimilar to the apparent process of evolution.
纯粹是机缘巧合，就在这个时候，我偶然发现了 Stacey Matrix。这是一种对组间协议类型进行分类的机制。在一个极端情况下，您的团队在高度不确定性方面远未达成共识；这是混乱和无政府状态的领域。在另一个极端，你有一些群体非常确定地接近一致，即简单的领域。 Stacey Matrix（见图 75）让我印象深刻的是领域的极端相反性质以及语言与明显的进化过程的相似之处。

Figure 75— Brenda Zimmerman’s simplified version of The Stacey Matrix
图 75 — Brenda Zimmerman 的 Stacey 矩阵的简化版本


With evolution, we had the more chaotic world of the novel and new with high degrees of uncertainty at one one extreme whilst at the other were more well understood activities. The matrix mimicked the same sort of conversations that I was having where people could agree that a commodity was a commodity but disagreed vehemently on what stage of evolution a less evolved component was in. It occurred to me that maybe these sorts of discussion and arguments would be occurring in journals and that somehow I might be able to use this to get an idea on how evolved something was? To be honest, I was just guessing by this point and was hoping to find some book where the answer would be magically written.
随着进化，我们有一个更加混乱的新世界，在一个极端具有高度的不确定性，而在另一个极端则是更容易理解的活动。该矩阵模仿了我所进行的相同类型的对话，在这些对话中，人们可以同意商品就是商品，但对于进化程度较低的组件所处的进化阶段存在强烈分歧。我突然想到，也许这些类型的讨论和争论会发生在期刊上，不知何故我可以用它来了解某物是如何进化的？老实说，我当时只是在猜测，希望能找到一本神奇地写下答案的书。

I headed back to the Library. I spent many months reading and trying to determine a measure for the certainty for an act. I was collecting all sorts of journals and categorising them when suddenly I noticed something odd. To be a bit more specific, I suddenly woke up one morning with this idea.
我回到图书馆。我花了好几个月的时间阅读并试图确定一个行为确定性的衡量标准。当我突然发现一些奇怪的东西时，我正在收集各种期刊并将它们分类。说得更具体一点，是有一天早上我突然被这个想法惊醒的。

It was by looking into the detail of journals and papers on various activities that I had noticed how the words they used had started to change. They always started talking about the “wonder” of some new thing such as the “wonder of television” but over time it became more about “use”. I then took 9,221 articles related to various activities and categorised those articles into four main stages based upon the words they used. I then plotted the frequency of publications — see figure 76.
通过查看有关各种活动的期刊和论文的详细信息，我注意到他们使用的词语已经开始发生变化。他们总是开始谈论一些新事物的 “奇迹”，例如 “电视的奇迹”，但随着时间的推移，它变得更多关于 “使用”。然后，我收集了 9,221 篇与各种活动相关的文章，并根据它们使用的词语将这些文章分为四个主要阶段。然后我绘制了出版物的频率——见图 76。

Figure 76 — Changing nature of publications
图 76 — 出版物性质的改变


To begin with, articles would discuss the wonder of the thing e.g. the wonder of radio. This would then be replaced with articles discussing building, construction and awareness e.g. how to build your own radio. These would then be replaced by articles discussing operation, maintenance and feature differentiation e.g. which radio is best. Finally, it would become dominated by use e.g. the Radio Times and what programs to listen to. Using stage II & III publications I developed a certainty scale.
首先，文章会讨论事物的奇妙之处，例如无线电的奇迹。然后，这将被讨论建筑、构造和意识的文章所取代，例如如何建立自己的收音机。然后这些将被讨论操作、维护和功能差异化的文章所取代，例如哪个收音机最好。最后，它会被使用所支配，例如 Radio Times 以及要收听的节目。使用第二阶段和第三阶段的出版物，我开发了一个确定性量表。

I felt I was getting close to something but I still couldn’t quite describe how evolution worked or why? I’m not sure what possessed me to do this, it was another one of those sleepless nights but I started to question if I could connect certainty to the applicable market and somehow work out the ubiquitous market? Obviously I could only do that for things which had already become a commodity. So, for various activities I marked a point of stability (I described this as 100% certain), the moment when publications changed from being dominated by operations, maintenance and feature differentiation to being dominated by use — see figure 77
我觉得我正在接近某些东西，但我仍然无法完全描述进化是如何运作的或为什么？我不确定是什么让我这么做，那是又一个不眠之夜，但我开始质疑我是否可以将确定性与适用市场联系起来并以某种方式解决无处不在的市场？显然我只能对已经成为商品的东西这样做。因此，对于各种活动，我标记了一个稳定点（我将其描述为 100% 确定），即出版物从以操作、维护和功能差异化为主转变为以使用为主的时刻 — 见图 77

Figure 77 — The point of stability
图 77——稳定点


Then I would take the time that this occurred (T1) and look up the applicable market for that activity at that time. I defined that applicable markets as the point of ubiquity (i.e. 100% ubiquitous) — see figure 78. I did this for radios, for TVs and all sorts of other common appliances.
然后我会利用发生这种情况的时间 (T1) 并查找当时该活动的适用市场。我将适用市场定义为无处不在的点（即 100% 无处不在）——见图 78。我为收音机、电视和所有其他常见电器做了这个。

Figure 78 — The point of ubiquity
图 78——无处不在的点


All of these markets were different sizes and different percentages of adoption and there was no obvious connection. At first I was disappointed but then I was just stumbling in the dark and didn’t know what I was looking for. By pure chance, whilst experimenting around with this, I took a wild stab and decided to plot ubiquity versus certainty for a range of activities. I had defined a point as 100% certain on my certainty scale and I had a corresponding point of ubiquity. I could now trace back through history to determine how certain and ubiquitous an act was. This is what I did for a range of activities and finally plotted a graph of ubiquity versus certainty. The result is provided in figure 79.
所有这些市场的规模和采用率都不同，并且没有明显的联系。起初我很失望，但后来我只是在黑暗中跌跌撞撞，不知道自己在寻找什么。纯属偶然，在尝试这个的同时，我大胆尝试并决定为一系列活动绘制普遍性与确定性的对比图。我已经将一个点定义为在我的确定性等级上 100% 确定，并且我有一个对应的普遍性点。我现在可以追溯历史以确定某个行为的确定性和普遍性。这就是我为一系列活动所做的，并最终绘制了一张普遍性与确定性的图表。结果在图 79 中提供。

I spent several hours staring at the result trying to understand what it meant. It suddenly dawned on me that every activity seemed to be following the same path. There was a strong correlation here. I then went back and overlaid those different stages of publication onto the graph and extended both ends as activities emerge before people start writing about them and continue well after becoming a commodity. I also gave each stage a generic term e.g. product for stage III and commodity for stage IV. The result was the evolution curve in figure 80 that I published in various guises (e.g. Butler Group Review, Mar 2008, Why Nothing is Simple in Management) and spoke enthusiastically about at numerous conferences.
我花了几个小时盯着结果，试图理解它的含义。我突然明白，每一项活动似乎都遵循着同一条道路。这里有很强的相关性。然后我回过头来，将这些不同的出版阶段叠加到图表上，并在人们开始撰写相关活动之前出现活动并在成为商品后继续开展活动时扩展两端。我还给每个阶段一个通用术语，例如第三阶段的产品和第四阶段的商品。结果是图 80 中的演化曲线，我以各种形式发表（例如 Butler Group Review，2008 年 3 月，《为什么管理中没有什么是简单的》），并在许多会议上热烈讨论。

Figure 80 — The evolution curve.
图 80 — 进化曲线。


Evolution begins with the genesis of an activity e.g. the first battery, the first phone, the first television or the first digital computer such as the Z3 in 1943. If it is successful, then it will diffuse in its applicable market. If it is useful then others will copy and custom-built examples of that activity will appear (e.g. systems such LEO — Lyons Electronic Office). They will also diffuse in what tends to be a larger applicable market. As the activity spreads through custom-built systems then pressure mounts for adoption and products are produced. These products themselves diffuse through an even wider market often with constant improvements or disruptive changes with each diffusing in turn and growing the market. As the act becomes more widespread and well understood alternative models of provision appear such as rental services. Eventually the act becomes so widespread and well defined it becomes “ubiquitous”, well understood and more of a commodity. It will tend to be standardised with little feature differentiation between offerings. At this stage of volume operations then utility services are likely to have appeared especially if the the act is suitable for delivery by such a mechanism.
进化始于活动的起源，例如第一块电池、第一部电话、第一台电视机或第一台数字计算机，如 1943 年的 Z3。如果成功，那么它将在其适用市场中扩散。如果它有用，那么其他人将复制并出现该活动的定制示例（例如 LEO — 里昂电子办公室等系统）。它们还将扩散到更大的适用市场。随着活动通过定制系统传播，采用和生产产品的压力就会增加。这些产品本身通过不断改进或破坏性变化传播到更广阔的市场，每一种产品依次传播并扩大市场。随着该法案变得更加普遍和广为人知，替代的提供模式出现了，例如租赁服务。最终，这种行为变得如此普遍和明确，以至于变得 “无处不在”、广为人知并且更像是一种商品。它将趋于标准化，产品之间的功能差异很小。在批量操作的这个阶段，公用事业服务很可能已经出现，特别是如果该行为适合通过这种机制提供。

There is no time or adoption axis on the evolution curve, only ubiquity (to its ubiquitous market) versus certainty. It may take ten years or a hundred for something to make its journey from genesis to commodity. It may become a commodity when 2% of the population own it or everyone has three. However, regardless of this, I know the path it will take. What causes things to take that journey turns out to be simple competition represented in two forms: -
进化曲线上没有时间轴或采用轴，只有普遍性（对其无处不在的市场）与确定性。某物从起源到商品化可能需要十年或一百年的时间。当 2% 的人口拥有它或每个人拥有三个时，它可能成为一种商品。然而，不管怎样，我知道它将要走的路。导致事情发生的原因是两种形式的简单竞争：-

Demand competition and the consumer desire for anything which is useful or makes a difference or creates an advantage is the driver for ubiquity i.e. anything useful spreads.
需求竞争和消费者对任何有用的、有影响的或创造优势的东西的渴望是无处不在的驱动力，即任何有用的传播。

Supply competition and the desire of providers to supply an activity to consumers is the driver for feature completeness and improvement of an activity. For example, an average car today includes as standard numerous things that were once novel feature differentiations such as electric windows, air bags, an alarm systems, a stereo, seat belts, roll bars and windscreen wipers. It’s the desire to differentiate and to make things better combined with competition and copying that drives things to become more uniform, more complete and more certain.
供应竞争和提供者向消费者提供活动的愿望是功能完整性和活动改进的驱动力。例如，今天的普通汽车标配了许多曾经是新颖的功能差异化的东西，例如电动车窗、安全气囊、警报系统、音响、安全带、防倾杆和挡风玻璃刮水器。正是这种差异化和让事物变得更好的愿望与竞争和复制相结合，驱使事物变得更统一、更完整和更确定。

It is important not to confuse evolution with diffusion though both patterns have an S-curve shape. The pattern of diffusion is one of adoption of a specific change over time whether that change is something novel or a feature differentiation or a particular business model. The first telephone diffused, a better method of producing glass known as the Pilkington float glass method diffused, new and improved washing powder diffuses and a utility model for provision of electricity diffused.
重要的是不要将进化与扩散混淆，尽管这两种模式都具有 S 曲线形状。扩散模式是随着时间的推移采用特定变化的一种方式，无论这种变化是新颖的、功能差异化的还是特定的商业模式。第一个电话扩散器，一种更好的生产玻璃的方法，称为皮尔金顿浮法玻璃扩散器，新的和改进的洗衣粉扩散器和提供电力扩散器的实用新型。

The pattern of evolution deals with the changing nature of something. It does not concern itself with adoption of a specific change (i.e. a better computer) but instead it shows how that activity itself has evolved from custom built to more of a product.
进化模式涉及事物不断变化的性质。它不关心采用特定更改（即更好的计算机），而是展示该活动本身如何从定制构建演变为更多产品。

Diffusion and evolution are of course connected. The evolution of an act can consist of thousands of diffusion curves of improving versions of that act, each with their own chasms. As an activity evolves, each more evolved version will diffuse from early adopters to laggards through its own applicable market. That market can and does grow as the act becomes more accessible to a larger audience. For example, with the first computing products you had early adopters and laggards within a relatively small market. As the products improved through constant incremental changes the applicable market grew significantly and later versions diffused through a much broader public market. Today, computing infrastructure is “ubiquitous” which is why we have utility services like Amazon EC2.
扩散和进化当然是相互关联的。一个行为的演变可以由数千条该行为改进版本的扩散曲线组成，每个版本都有自己的鸿沟。随着一项活动的发展，每一个更进化的版本都会通过其适用的市场从早期采用者扩散到落后者。随着更多观众更容易接触到该行为，该市场可以而且确实会增长。例如，对于第一款计算产品，您在相对较小的市场中拥有早期采用者和落后者。随着产品通过不断的增量变化得到改进，适用的市场显着增长，后来的版本通过更广泛的公共市场传播。今天，计算基础设施 “无处不在”，这就是我们拥有像 Amazon EC2 这样的实用服务的原因。

It’s important to note that unlike diffusion, evolution cannot be determined over time. It can only be measured over the ubiquity of the act versus its certainty i.e. how complete, well understood and fit for purpose it is. Whilst we can use the evolution curve to say that a specific component will evolve over an undetermined amount of time to become more of a commodity, we cannot say precisely when this will happen but only what will happen if it survives. It is less prediction (in the formal sense of change over time) and more anticipation of change.
重要的是要注意，与扩散不同，进化不能随着时间的推移而确定。它只能通过行为的普遍性与其确定性进行衡量，即它的完整性、理解程度和适合目的的程度。虽然我们可以使用进化曲线来说明特定组件将在不确定的时间内进化成为更多的商品，但我们不能准确地说出这将在何时发生，只能说如果它存活下来会发生什么。它是较少的预测（在随时间变化的正式意义上）和更多的变化预期。

Furthermore, the evolution curve can only be precisely determined for the past i.e. the act needs to become stable and reach the point of certainty for us to determine its point of ubiquity and therefore calculate the path it has taken. This means we cannot accurately determine where something is on the evolution curve until it has become a commodity, at which point we can determine where it was in the past. Hence, we are forced to rely on a cheat sheet based upon changing characteristics (chapter 2) along with weak signal analysis to estimate where something is.
此外，只能精确确定过去的演化曲线，即行为需要变得稳定并达到确定点，我们才能确定其普遍性点，从而计算其所采取的路径。这意味着我们无法准确确定某物在进化曲线上的位置，直到它成为商品，此时我们才能确定它过去的位置。因此，我们不得不依赖基于不断变化的特征（第 2 章）以及弱信号分析的备忘单来估计某物的位置。

There is unfortunately, no crystal ball to the future and we have to embrace a degree of uncertainty until it reaches the point of stability and becomes certain. Since we must rely on changing characteristics and weak signals (if available) to determine where something is on a map then a current map is developed from the consensus of those involved. This can be manipulated or influenced by existing bias hence it is important to not only be transparent with the maps but allow for challenge to them. The maps are imperfect representations of what exists and the axis do constrain a view of the world based upon the anchor (user need), the value chain (position) and evolution (movement). The mapper must accept that the maps are not real any more than a geographical map is real. The question however is not whether it is real but whether it is useful.
不幸的是，未来没有水晶球，我们必须接受一定程度的不确定性，直到它达到稳定点并变得确定。由于我们必须依靠不断变化的特征和微弱信号（如果可用）来确定某物在地图上的位置，因此当前地图是根据相关人员的共识制定的。这可能会受到现有偏见的操纵或影响，因此重要的是不仅要对地图保持透明，而且要允许对它们提出挑战。这些地图是对存在事物的不完美表示，轴确实基于锚点（用户需求）、价值链（位置）和进化（运动）限制了世界观。制图者必须接受地图不是真实的，就像地理地图不是真实的一样。然而，问题不在于它是否真实，而在于它是否有用。

As evolution deals with the change to the act itself, it does not care whether some specific change is incremental or disruptive to the past. A company may produce a better product (e.g. a better cable excavator) or instead a product may be substituted by another (e.g. cable vs. hydraulic excavators) but the act of “digging holes” doesn’t change. Instead we simply have a more evolved way of doing this. Today, the evolution of computing infrastructure from product to utility is disruptive for the past product industry but the act of consuming computing infrastructure isn’t new, it is simply more evolved.
由于进化处理的是行为本身的变化，它并不关心某些特定的变化是对过去的增量还是破坏。一家公司可能会生产更好的产品（例如更好的电缆挖掘机），或者一种产品可能会被另一种产品替代（例如电缆与液压挖掘机），但 “挖洞” 的行为不会改变。相反，我们只是有一种更先进的方式来做到这一点。今天，计算基础设施从产品到实用程序的演变对过去的产品行业来说是颠覆性的，但消费计算基础设施的行为并不新鲜，它只是更进化了。

Every activity I have examined throughout history follows this path.
我研究过的所有历史活动都遵循这条路径。

The genesis of the humble screw can be traced back to Archytas of Tarentum (400 BC). The principle was later refined by Archimedes and also used to construct devices to raise water. Over the next two thousand years most screws (and any associated bolts) were cut by hand however demand for screw threads and fasteners created increasing pressure for a more industrialised process. J and W Wyatt had patented such a concept in 1760 and Jesse Ramsden in 1770 introduced the first form of screw cutting lathe. However without a practical means of achieving industrialisation and with no standards then the industry continued primarily as was. Maudslay then introduced the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 that combined elements such as the slide rest, change gears and lead-screw to achieve the effect. However, whilst screws and bolts could be manufactured with inter-changeable components, the lack of any standards thwarted general inter-changeability. In 1841, James Whitworth collected a large number of samples from British manufacturers and proposed a set of standards including the angle of thread and threads per inches. The proposals became standard practice in 1860 and a highly standardised and industrialised sector developed that we recognise today.
不起眼的螺丝的起源可以追溯到 Tarentum 的 Archytas（公元前 400 年）。该原理后来被阿基米德改进，并用于建造提水装置。在接下来的 2000 年里，大多数螺钉（以及任何相关的螺栓）都是手工切割的，但是对螺纹和紧固件的需求为更加工业化的工艺创造了越来越大的压力。 J 和 W Wyatt 于 1760 年为这一概念申请了专利，Jesse Ramsden 于 1770 年推出了第一台螺旋切削车床。然而，如果没有实现工业化的实用手段，也没有标准，那么这个行业就只能照原样继续下去。 Maudslay 随后于 1800 年推出了第一台工业上实用的螺纹切削车床，它结合了滑架、变速齿轮和丝杠等元素来实现这种效果。然而，虽然螺钉和螺栓可以用可互换的部件制造，但缺乏任何标准阻碍了一般的互换性。 1841 年，James Whitworth 从英国制造商那里收集了大量样品，并提出了一套包括螺纹角度和每英寸螺纹数的标准。这些提议在 1860 年成为标准做法，一个高度标准化和工业化的部门发展成为我们今天所认识的。
The history of electrical power generation can be traced from its genesis with the Parthian battery (around 200AD) to custom-built examples of generators such as the Hippolyte Pixii (1832) to the first products such as Siemens Generators (1866) to Westinghouse’s utility provision of AC electricity (1886) and the subsequent standardisation of electricity provision from the introduction of the first standard plugs and sockets to standards for transmission and the formation of national grids (UK National Grid, 1926).
发电的历史可以追溯到帕提亚电池的起源（大约公元 200 年），到 Hippolyte Pixii（1832 年）等发电机的定制示例，再到西门子发电机（1866 年）等第一批产品，再到西屋公司的公用事业供应交流电（1886 年）和随后的电力供应标准化，从第一个标准插头和插座的引入到传输标准和国家电网的形成（英国国家电网，1926 年）。
The history of modern computing infrastructure can be traced from its genesis with the Z3 computer (1943) to custom built examples such as LEO or Lyons Electronic Office (1949) to the first products such as IBM 650 (1953) to rental services such as Tymshare (1964) to commodity provision of computing infrastructure and more recently utility provision with Amazon EC2 (2006).
现代计算基础设施的历史可以追溯到 Z3 计算机 (1943) 的起源，到 LEO 或 Lyons Electronic Office (1949) 等定制示例，再到 IBM 650 (1953) 等第一批产品，再到 Tymshare 等租赁服务 (1964) 到计算基础设施的商品供应和最近使用 Amazon EC2 的公用事业供应 (2006)。
It’s also worth noting the hockey stick effect of the graph. When a novel activity appears, it first evolves mainly through understanding rather than rapidly spreading. As our understanding of the activity increases, we reach a tipping point that the act now rapidly spreads through multiple waves of custom built examples and then products. As the act becomes widespread, our understanding of it increases until this becomes embedded in our social systems and in many cases almost invisible. We no longer consider how it is constructed, it is almost a given and can in many cases be buried in higher order systems as a component e.g. the once wonder of the nut and bolt is now hidden inside the machine or the car or the toaster.
还值得注意的是图表的曲棍球棒效应。当一种新的活动出现时，它首先主要是通过理解而不是迅速传播而进化。随着我们对活动的了解增加，我们达到了一个转折点，即该行为现在通过定制示例和产品的多波浪潮迅速传播。随着该行为的广泛传播，我们对它的理解不断加深，直到它融入我们的社会系统，并且在许多情况下几乎不可见。我们不再考虑它是如何构造的，它几乎是给定的，并且在许多情况下可以作为一个组件埋在高阶系统中，例如曾经的螺母和螺栓奇迹现在隐藏在机器、汽车或​​烤面包机内。

For interest, this hockey stick pattern is similar to that found by Boiset, Canals and Macmillan in their simulation of I-Space using an agent-based approach to modelling knowledge flows. Their work looked at how knowledge spreads through economic and social systems by examining the interactions of agents (i.e. individuals). One of the things they demonstrated confirmed a previous expectation that knowledge is first abstracted and codified before it rapidly diffuses (see figure 81). The is the same pattern within my data where first our understanding and certainty over an activity increases (i.e. it is abstracted and codified) before it rapidly becomes widespread.
有趣的是，这种曲棍球棒模式类似于 Boiset、Canals 和 Macmillan 在他们使用基于代理的知识流建模方法模拟 I-Space 时发现的模式。他们的工作通过检查代理人（即个人）的相互作用来研究知识如何在经济和社会系统中传播。他们展示的其中一件事证实了先前的预期，即知识在迅速传播之前首先被抽象和编码（见图 81）。这与我的数据中的模式相同，首先我们对一项活动的理解和确定性会增加（即它被抽象和编码），然后才会迅速普及。

The pattern of evolution that I used as the x-axis of my map had some sense of validity in history. I could with some confidence describe how things would evolve even though I couldn’t say precisely when.
我用作地图 x 轴的进化模式在历史上具有一定的有效性。我可以自信地描述事情将如何演变，尽管我不能准确地说出时间。

Looking back, I could now see that the term “innovation” does appear to be currently used to describe changes in different states of evolution. Some things described as “innovations” are genuinely novel, new and hence uncertain activities (i.e. genesis). By virtue of being uncertain then the appearance of these is almost impossible to predict and you cannot know with certainty what will appear. However, many things described as “innovations” are simply improvements to an existing activity and part of a visible process of evolution that is driven by competition. Whilst you cannot predict when these changes will occur as evolution cannot be plotted over time, you can predict what will happen. This notion is contrary to the more random perception of “innovation”. Amazon EC2, a utility computing infrastructure service (commonly known as cloud computing) wasn’t a random accident but instead it was inevitable that some company would provide utility computing infrastructure.
回过头来看，我现在可以看到 “创新” 一词目前似乎确实被用来描述不同进化状态的变化。一些被描述为 “创新” 的事物是真正新颖的，因此是不确定的活动（即起源）。由于不确定，因此几乎无法预测这些事件的出现，您也无法确定会出现什么。然而，许多被描述为 “创新” 的事物只是对现有活动的改进，是竞争驱动的可见进化过程的一部分。虽然您无法预测这些变化何时会发生，因为无法随时间绘制进化图，但您可以预测会发生什么。这个概念与更随机的 “创新” 观念相反。 Amazon EC2，一种效用计算基础设施服务（俗称云计算），不是偶然的，而是一些公司提供效用计算基础设施是不可避免的。

Far from being like navigators in a storm constantly coping with the maelstrom around us, it appears that the sea has structure. Mapping seemed to have merit and I had a purpose, to teach everyone who would listen. Alas, it was 2008 and I was fast running out of cash. I would have to turn mapping to a profit one way or another.
大海远非像暴风雨中的航海者那样不断应对我们周围的漩涡，海洋似乎是有结构的。绘图似乎有其价值，我有一个目的，就是教每个愿意听的人。 las，那是 2008 年，我的现金快用完了。我将不得不以一种或另一种方式将映射转化为利润。

I’ve covered quite a few concepts & hypothesis in this chapter and to be honest, I could probably write an entire book on this one topic alone. However, we’ve got a lot more to cover and so I think it’s probably worth highlighting some lessons and moving on.
我在本章中介绍了很多概念和假设，老实说，我可能仅就这个主题写一整本书。然而，我们还有很多内容要涵盖，所以我认为可能值得强调一些经验教训并继续前进。

Purpose, Scope and Imperative 目的、范围和必要性
Purpose, scope, moral imperative, survival and user needs can be connected in a chain of needs.
目的、范围、道德要求、生存和用户需求可以在需求链中联系起来。
All will evolve and be effected by the chain they exist within. Nothing is permanent.
一切都将发展并受到它们存在于其中的链条的影响。没有什么是永恒的。
Scope should be tangible and easy to understand but you also need a moral imperative to enthuse people.
范围应该是有形的且易于理解，但您还需要一种道德要求来激发人们的兴趣。
Aim to create revenue and profit — your need to survive — by meeting your users’ needs.
旨在通过满足用户的需求来创造收入和利润——你生存的需要。
There is often a balancing act between different conflicting user needs.
在不同的相互冲突的用户需求之间通常存在平衡行为。
Landscape
Your map is always part of a wider chain of needs, it is no more than a window on an industry. A perfect map covering an entire industry and all its components is probably as unusable (Valéry’s paradox) as a perfect map of France (i.e. 1 to 1 scale). You have to accept some compromise.
您的地图始终是更广泛的需求链的一部分，它只不过是一个行业的窗口。一张涵盖整个行业及其所有组成部分的完美地图可能与一张完美的法国地图（即 1 比 1 比例）一样无法使用（瓦莱里悖论）。你必须接受一些妥协。
You can draw many organisations onto a single map. The value chain is only a guide and higher up the value chain simply means more visible to that user. You can always draw chains of users e.g. the user needs for a gun company breakdown into the user needs for a bolt company.
您可以将许多组织绘制到一张地图上。价值链只是一个指南，价值链的上层仅仅意味着该用户更容易看到。您始终可以绘制用户链，例如枪支公司的用户需求细分为螺栓公司的用户需求。
Maps are a communication tool. Don’t be afraid to modify or clarify the terms on the axis if it helps in the discussion. Key is to keep within the bounds of what is a map, particularly position (e.g. value chain) and movement (e.g. evolution)
地图是一种交流工具。如果有助于讨论，不要害怕修改或澄清轴上的术语。关键是要保持在地图的范围内，特别是位置（例如价值链）和运动（例如进化）
The map of mapping (figure 69) contains components which are also the axes of the map i.e. the idea of evolution is itself evolving along the evolution scale. Mapping can be applied to itself. It also means that these current maps are little more than Babylonian Clay Tablets. Someone will make a better map.
映射地图（图 69）包含的组件也是地图的轴，即进化的概念本身是沿着进化尺度进化的。映射可以应用于自身。这也意味着这些当前地图只不过是巴比伦泥板。有人会制作更好的地图。
There are many different things which we call innovation — this includes genesis of an act, feature differentiation of a product and a shifting business model from product to utility. They are very different despite our use of a single term to describe them.
我们将许多不同的事物称为创新——这包括行为的起源、产品的特征差异化以及从产品到实用程序的商业模式转变。尽管我们使用一个术语来描述它们，但它们非常不同。
Climate : Evolution 气候：进化
You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption.
您无法衡量随着时间的推移或采用情况的演变。
Evolution is measured over ubiquity versus certainty. The “ubiquitous” market for one activity (e.g. smartphones) is not necessarily the same as the “ubiquitous” market for another (e.g. gold bars).
进化是通过普遍性和确定性来衡量的。一种活动（例如智能手机）的 “无处不在” 市场不一定与另一种活动（例如金条）的 “无处不在” 市场相同。
Evolution consists of multiple diffusion curves. Evolution and diffusion are connected but separate concepts. Don’t confuse the two.
进化由多个扩散曲线组成。进化和扩散是相互联系但又相互独立的概念。不要混淆两者。
Evolution is driven by supply and demand competition.
进化是由供需竞争驱动的。
Whilst we cannot say when things will happen (we can cheat with weak signal analysis), we can describe what will happen i.e. this will evolve to more of a commodity. Evolution shows you a path but there is no crystal ball to predicting the future. We have to embrace uncertainty. The less evolved something is (i.e. the less certain we are about it, see figure 71) then by definition the more uncertain it becomes.
虽然我们不能说事情什么时候会发生（我们可以通过弱信号分析作弊），但我们可以描述将会发生什么，即这将演变为更多的商品。进化为您指明了一条道路，但没有预测未来的水晶球。我们必须接受不确定性。某物进化程度越低（即我们对它的确定性越低，见图 71），那么根据定义，它就变得越不确定。
The idea of evolution is itself evolving and is therefore uncertain. All models are wrong, some are merely useful.
进化的概念本身也在进化，因此是不确定的。所有模型都是错误的，有些只是有用的。
I’ve marked off the list of climatic patterns that we’ve covered so far in orange in figure 82. Before long we will be anticipating change like a professional.
我已经在图 82 中用橙色标记了迄今为止我们涵盖的气候模式列表。不久之后，我们将像专业人士一样期待变化。
